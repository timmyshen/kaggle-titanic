This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

train <- readr::read_csv('./train.csv')
test <- readr::read_csv('./test.csv')

train_label <- train %>% mutate(label='train')
test_label <- test %>% mutate(label='test', Survived=NA)
train_test <- rbind(train_label, test_label)
```


```{r}
train_test$Embarked <- as.factor(train_test$Embarked)
# train_test$Cabin <- as.factor(train_test$Cabin)
train_test$Sex <- as.factor(train_test$Sex)
train_test$Pclass <- as.factor(train_test$Pclass)
```

Feature Engineer Cabin
```{r}
train_test <-
  train_test %>% mutate(Cabin_Type=substr(Cabin, 1, 1))

train_test[is.na(train_test$Fare), "Fare"] <-
  median(train_test$Fare, na.rm = TRUE)
train_test[is.na(train_test$Age), "Age"] <-
  median(train_test$Age, na.rm = TRUE)

```


```{r}
str(train_test)
```

```{r}
library(caret)
```

```{r}
